  <h1>About Me<h1>
    <p> Ever since I was little my parents taught me to have clear goals so that I know what I’m doing with my life, goals for me divide into two categories, the first one is personal life and the second one is professional life. In my personal life I’m working on getting good grades at school, getting a scholarship for college, traveling around the world, and maybe have an exchange year in Swiss. In my professional life I’m working in learning new skills that will help me when I have a job, and I’m trying to find a part time job, my long-term goal is correlated with one of my personal goals, which is that while travelling I can write and, in this way, inform people about what is happening around the world.  To achieve these goals, I’m doing my best at school and looking for opportunities. In my opinion, the most necessary values for success are: resilience, patience, adaptability, open minded, and respect. My short-term goals are getting a scholarship and study either journalism or psychology, I also want to find a job and buy my own car. The character traits and achievements I want to be known for are being good listener, being effective, punctual and doing on time what I have to do, not being mediocre and putting effort on everything I do. </p>
